    <p> Joychandi Pahar is a scenic hill located near Raghunathpur in Purulia district, West Bengal, approximately 45 km from Asansol. Rising to about 800 feet, it is renowned for its rugged terrain, making it a favored spot for rock climbing and trekking enthusiasts. The hill is crowned by the Joychandi Mata Temple, accessible via approximately 490 well-maintained steps. Surrounded by lush greenery and diverse flora, including numerous plant and butterfly species, the area offers breathtaking panoramic views. Joychandi Pahar gained cultural prominence as the filming location for Satyajit Ray's classic movie "Hirak Rajar Deshe." Each year, a tourism festival is held at its base, celebrating local art and culture. Easily accessible via the Joychandipahar Railway Station on the Asansolâ€“Adra main and cord line, this destination is ideal for nature lovers, adventure seekers, and cultural enthusiasts alike. </p>

    <p> Garh Panchkot is a historic site nestled at the foothills of Panchet Hill in Purulia district, West Bengal, approximately 65 km from Asansol. Once the capital of the Panchkot Raj, established by Damodar Sekhar around 80 AD, it flourished until the 18th century. The area is renowned for its ruins, including the Pancharatna temple, Jor-Bangla structures, and remnants of the Rani Mahal, showcasing Bengalâ€™s rich architectural heritage. The fort complex, surrounded by dense forests and hills, offers a glimpse into medieval life and legends, such as the tragic tale of the king's 17 queens during Maratha invasions. Today, Garh Panchkot is a popular destination for history enthusiasts and nature lovers, offering trekking opportunities, panoramic views, and a serene environment. Its proximity to attractions like Panchet Dam and Joychandi Hills further enhances its appeal as a weekend getaway. </p>

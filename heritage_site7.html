    <p> Maithon Dam is a major multipurpose dam located approximately 25 km from Asansol, straddling the border of Jharkhand and West Bengal. Constructed in 1957 by the Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC), it spans the Barakar River, a tributary of the Damodar River. The dam stretches over 15,712 feet (4,790 meters) and stands 165 feet (50 meters) high, creating the expansive Maithon Lake, which covers about 65 square kilometers.Designed primarily for flood control and power generation, Maithon Dam houses South East Asia's first underground hydel power station, capable of generating 60 MW of electricity. The surrounding area, with its lush greenery and scenic beauty, makes it a popular destination for picnics, boating, and nature walks. Maithon Dam stands as a testament to India's early post-independence infrastructure development and continues to play a vital role in regional water management and energy production.</p>

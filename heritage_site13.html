    <p> Kazi Nazrul Academy, established in 1958 in Churulia, West Bengal, is a cultural institution dedicated to preserving the legacy of the renowned Bengali poet Kazi Nazrul Islam. Situated in his birthplace, the academy houses a museum that showcases rare manuscripts, personal belongings, photographs, and medallions of the poet. Notably, it preserves thirteen exercise books filled with Nazrul's handwritten poems, songs, and dramas, dating from 1920 to 1950. In 2021, the academy was officially dissolved, and its collection was entrusted to Kazi Nazrul University for preservation and digitization. The academy complex also includes a library and is adjacent to educational institutions like Churulia Nazrul Vidyapith and Kazi Nazrul Islam Mahavidyalaya. Annually, the academy organizes the Nazrul Jayanti festival, celebrating the poet's contributions to literature and music. Easily accessible from Asansol, it remains a significant site for those interested in Bengal's literary heritage. </p>

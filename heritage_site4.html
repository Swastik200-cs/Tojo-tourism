    <p> Sacred Heart Cathedral, located on G.T. Road in Asansol, West Bengal, is a historic Roman Catholic church established in 1875 by the East Indian Railway Company to serve the growing Christian community during the colonial era. The church was first blessed on Christmas night in 1876. Its red-brick Gothic architecture features castle-like towers, arched windows, and a central dome, making it a prominent landmark in the city. In 1998, it was elevated to cathedral status when Pope John Paul II created the Diocese of Asansol. The cathedral complex includes grottos, a well-maintained garden, and several religious sculptures, including 'Our Lady of Lourdes.' It also houses St. Maria Goretti School, established in 1949 for Hindi-speaking girls. The cathedral remains a center of faith and community service in Asansol. </p>

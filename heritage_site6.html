    <p> Ghagar Buri Chandi Temple, located on Kali Pahari near the Nunia River in Asansol, West Bengal, is the city's oldest temple, established in 1620 by Atul Prasad Chakraborty. Dedicated to Goddess Ghagar Buri, an incarnation of Maa Chandi, the temple's origin is linked to a legend where a priest, Kangali Charon Chakraborty, dreamt of the goddess instructing him to worship three stones, which became the temple's deities(idols). The temple features a saffron and pink facade adorned with the Trishul symbol and houses idols of Ghagar Buri, Durga, and Mahadev. A significant fair is held annually on 15th January , attracting numerous devotees. The temple is open daily from 7 AM to 7 PM and is easily accessible via National Highway 2, approximately 3 km from Asansol's Main city center. </p>

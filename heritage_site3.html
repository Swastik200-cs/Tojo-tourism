    <p>Nehru Park, also known as Lahmeyer Park or Riverside Park, is a prominent recreational spot in Burnpur, Asansol, West Bengal. Situated along the banks of the Damodar River, the park spans approximately 64 acres and was originally developed by F.W.A. Lahmeyer, a German engineer associated with the IISCO Steel Plant. In 1989, it was renamed to honor India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, and features a cast-iron statue of him at the entrance. The park boasts lush gardens, winding walkways, a musical fountain operating on weekends and Thursdays, and a serene stream flowing through its landscape. </p>

    <p> Bishnupur, located in Bankura district of West Bengal, is renowned for its rich heritage, especially the exquisite terracotta temples built by the Malla dynasty between the 17th and 18th centuries. These temples, such as Rasmancha and Jor Bangla, showcase intricate terracotta carvings depicting scenes from Hindu epics. The town is also famous for its traditional Baluchari silk sarees and Bishnupur Gharana of classical music. Bishnupur is approximately 125 km from Asansol, with convenient connectivity via road and rail. Trains like the HWH CKP Express and buses operate regularly between the two towns, making it accessible for tourists and pilgrims. The serene ambiance, coupled with its historical significance, makes Bishnupur a must-visit destination for those interested in art, culture, and history. </p>
